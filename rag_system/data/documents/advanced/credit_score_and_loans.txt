Title: Understanding Credit Score and Loan Eligibility

A credit score is a numerical representation of your creditworthiness. It ranges from 300 to 900 in India. A higher score improves loan approval chances.

Banks use your credit score to evaluate risk before approving loans or credit cards.

To maintain a good score:
1. Pay EMIs and credit card bills on time.
2. Avoid taking too many loans.
3. Keep your credit utilization below 30%.

Credit bureaus like CIBIL and Experian maintain credit records. You can check your score annually for free on approved platforms.

A good credit score leads to lower interest rates and faster loan approvals.
