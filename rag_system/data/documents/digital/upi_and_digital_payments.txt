Title: Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and Digital Payments

The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is an instant payment system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). It allows users to transfer money between bank accounts using a mobile app.

UPI transactions work 24x7 and are free for most users. Every user has a Virtual Payment Address (VPA), such as name@bank.

Popular UPI apps include BHIM, Google Pay, PhonePe, and Paytm. Transactions can be made using UPI ID, QR code, or mobile number.

For security, every UPI transaction requires a PIN. Banks and NPCI never ask for your PIN or OTP. Never share your credentials with anyone.

Digital payments include UPI, net banking, debit/credit cards, and wallets. They promote transparency and reduce cash dependency.

In case of unauthorized transactions, users should immediately report to their bank or through the UPI app’s grievance redressal section.

NPCI recommends verifying payment requests and double-checking UPI IDs before transferring funds.
