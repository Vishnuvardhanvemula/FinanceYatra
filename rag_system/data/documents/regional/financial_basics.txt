EMI (Equated Monthly Installment)
==================================================

EMI stands for Equated Monthly Installment. It is a fixed payment amount made by a borrower to a lender at a specified date each calendar month. EMIs are used to pay off both interest and principal each month, so that over a specified number of years, the loan is fully paid off.

The EMI formula is:
EMI = [P x R x (1+R)^N]/[(1+R)^N-1]

Where:
- P = Principal loan amount (the amount you borrow)
- R = Rate of interest per month (annual rate divided by 12 and 100)
- N = Number of monthly installments (loan tenure in months)

Example:
If you take a home loan of ₹10,00,000 at 8% annual interest for 20 years:
- Principal (P) = ₹10,00,000
- Monthly interest rate (R) = 8/(12*100) = 0.00667
- Number of months (N) = 20 * 12 = 240 months
- EMI = approximately ₹8,364 per month

Types of loans with EMI:
1. Home Loans - for purchasing property
2. Car Loans - for vehicle purchase
3. Personal Loans - for various needs
4. Education Loans - for higher studies

Tips for managing EMI:
- Never let your total EMI exceed 40-50% of your monthly income
- Compare interest rates from different banks
- Try to make prepayments to reduce interest burden
- Set up auto-debit to avoid missing payments
