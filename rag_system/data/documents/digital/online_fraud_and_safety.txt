Title: Online Financial Safety and Fraud Prevention

Online fraud occurs when scammers trick users into sharing personal or financial information.

Common scams include phishing links, fake UPI payment requests, and OTP scams.

Always check URLs before entering credentials. Never share your PIN, OTP, or passwords with anyone.

Banks and RBI never call to ask for such details. Report suspicious activity to your bank or on the National Cybercrime Helpline (1930).

Enable two-factor authentication on banking apps and regularly update your passwords.
