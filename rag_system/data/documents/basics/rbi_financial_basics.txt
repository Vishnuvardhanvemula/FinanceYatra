Title: Understanding Basic Banking and Savings

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) promotes financial literacy through simple explanations of core banking concepts.

A Savings Account is a deposit account held at a bank that earns interest over time. It helps people store money safely and withdraw when needed.

Interest is the amount of money a bank pays to the account holder for keeping their money in the bank. It is expressed as a percentage of the principal amount.

EMI stands for Equated Monthly Installment. It is a fixed amount paid by a borrower to a lender every month to repay a loan. Each EMI consists of both principal and interest components.

Fixed Deposit (FD) is a type of savings instrument where money is locked for a certain period and earns a higher rate of interest compared to a savings account.

Maintaining a savings habit is the first step towards financial security. Banks also offer recurring deposits for regular monthly savings.

The RBI encourages people to compare interest rates, understand loan terms, and avoid borrowing beyond their repayment capacity.
