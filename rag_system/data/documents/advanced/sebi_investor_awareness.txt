Title: Basics of Investments and Investor Awareness

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulates the securities market in India and protects investor interests.

Investment means putting money into financial instruments to earn a return. Common investment options include fixed deposits, mutual funds, bonds, and shares.

Mutual Funds pool money from many investors and invest it into a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds, managed by professionals.

Before investing, investors should check the fund’s objectives, risk level, and historical performance.

The stock market allows investors to buy and sell shares of companies. Prices are influenced by demand, company performance, and market trends.

SEBI warns against Ponzi and unregistered schemes. Always verify if an intermediary or financial advisor is registered with SEBI.

Long-term investing and diversification reduce risk. Avoid emotional decisions based on market rumors.
