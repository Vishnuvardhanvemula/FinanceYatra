Title: Understanding Savings and Interest

Saving means setting aside part of your income for future needs. It helps in emergencies and builds long-term wealth.

Interest is the amount earned on your savings. It can be simple interest or compound interest.

Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100  
Compound Interest = Principal × (1 + Rate/100)^Time - Principal

Recurring Deposits allow you to deposit a fixed amount monthly and earn interest on it. It encourages consistent saving habits.

The habit of saving regularly ensures financial independence and provides funds for future goals such as education, marriage, or retirement.
