Title: Understanding Insurance and Loans

Insurance is a contract between an individual and an insurance company where the insurer promises to compensate for specific losses in exchange for a premium.

Types of insurance include life insurance, health insurance, vehicle insurance, and property insurance.

Loans allow individuals or businesses to borrow money with an obligation to repay with interest. The loan repayment is usually done through EMIs.

Before taking a loan, borrowers should compare interest rates, read the loan agreement carefully, and ensure they can afford monthly payments.

Collateral is an asset pledged to the lender as security for the loan. If the borrower fails to repay, the lender can claim the collateral.

Financial planning involves managing income, expenses, savings, and investments to achieve personal goals. Insurance and responsible borrowing are key parts of financial stability.
